I'm a full-stack web developer with a passion for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and its ecosystem. My other interests include _software development_, _Linux_, _free and open-source software_, _online privacy_, _Docker_, and _self-hosting_. On this blog, I want to share experiences, ideas, and discoveries around web and technology.

The name _FjellOverflow_ is a creative blend of the Norwegian word _Fjell_ (meaning mountain) and _Overflow_. It's a playful nod to the common computer science issue, the _stack overflow_, where a program runs out of memory due to errors. The name draws inspiration from the virtual _mountain_ of a stack, reflecting in the mountain-themed logo.
